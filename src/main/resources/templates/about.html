            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                We're a team of overcaffeinated students, former and existing flatmates, and spreadsheet-weary adults who decided:
                "What if flatting didn't suck?" That idea became <strong>Flattie.com</strong> — your go-to toolkit for keeping the flat running like a slightly oiled machine.

            <h2>What This App Does</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rent Delegation Calculator:</strong> Fairly split the rent without Excel rage-quits.</li>
                <li><strong>Chore List:</strong> Assign tasks, mark them done, and eliminate mystery messes.</li>
                <li><strong>Shopping List:</strong> Share one list, so five people don't buy the same oat milk.</li>
                <li><strong>Flat Management:</strong> Create, join, and manage flats — code-based, secure, and roommate-friendly.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Why We Built It -->
        <section>
            <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
            <p>
                Because every flat deserves more peace and fewer passive-aggressive sticky notes. We built Flattie to
                give flatmates a shared hub where fairness, clarity, and just a pinch of automation can make communal living a little more... livable.

            <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
            <p>
                Create an account, make or join a flat, and start delegating like a flat boss. Don't worry — it's easier
                than assembling a flatpack shelf.
