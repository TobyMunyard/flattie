# Flattie
## What is Flattie?
Flattie is a flat management web application intended to be used by students who are flatting as well as property managers. It is being developed by students of [INFO310 Software Project Management](https://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/papers?papercode=INFO310) at [The University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/).

## Accessing Flattie
By downloading the source code from this repository! Simply run the application as you would any other Java based project and either click the link output in your terminal pointing you to the webpage or access localhost:8080 in your favourite web browser.

## Languages
Flattie's backend is built using [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) with [Spring](https://spring.io/). The frontend is built in standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) template engine to merge the content of the front and back. The data is currently stored in a in-memory [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) SQL database for the purposes of testing and ease of use.
